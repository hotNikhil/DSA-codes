//Problem Statement:You are given two numbers a and b. The task is to count the number of bits needed to be flipped to convert a to b.
Note : flipping of bit means inverting its value -- changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.

//code:
//first do the XOR of both the numbers then count the setBits.

 int countBitsFlip(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        int xored = a^b;
        int count = 0;
        while(xored){
            if(xored &1) count++;
            xored = xored>>1;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
