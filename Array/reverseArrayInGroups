//Statement

Given an array arr[] of positive integers. Reverse every sub-array group of size k.
Note: If at any instance, k is greater or equal to the array size, then reverse the entire array. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3
Output: [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]
Explanation: First group consists of elements 1, 2, 3. Second group consists of 4, 5.
Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 8, 9], k = 5
Output: [9, 8, 6, 5]
Explnation: Since k is greater than array size, the entire array is reversed.


code:

void reverseInGroups(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        for(int i=0; i<n; i+=k){
            int start = i;
            int end = min(i+k-1 , n-1); // handle the cases where k leads to unbounded indices
            while(start<end){
                swap(arr[start] , arr[end]);
                start++;
                end--;
            }
        }
    }
